# 🎶 Code, Music, and Curiosity — That’s My Rhythm

Hi, I’m **Nakshatra** — a Computer Engineering student passionate about turning bold ideas into clean, creative software.

Whether it’s building 🧩 WordPress plugins, crafting ⚙️ data pipelines, developing 📊 dashboards, building 📱 cross-platform apps with Flutter, experimenting with 🤖 AI, or exploring 🌐 Web3 and blockchain systems — I love writing code that solves real problems and scales with clarity.

I value 🤝 open-source collaboration, thoughtful 🧠 backend architecture, and making software that feels as good as it functions.
