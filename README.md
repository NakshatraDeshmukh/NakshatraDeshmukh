# 🎶 Code, Music, and Curiosity — That’s My Rhythm

Hi, I’m **Nakshatra** — a Computer Engineering student passionate about turning bold ideas into clean, creative software.

Whether it's building a 🧩 WordPress plugin, designing ⚙️ data pipelines, or exploring 🌐 Web3 tech, I love writing code that solves real problems and scales with clarity.

I value 🤝 open-source collaboration, thoughtful 🧠 backend architecture, and making software that feels as good as it functions.
