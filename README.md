# 🎶 Code, Music, and Curiosity — That’s My Rhythm.

Hi, I’m Nakshatra — a Computer Engineering student passionate about turning bold ideas into practical, creative solutions.

Whether it's building a WordPress plugin, a blockchain-based CertiGuard system, or designing real-time data pipelines, I love writing clean, purposeful code that solves real problems — and scales with clarity.

I value open-source collaboration, thoughtful backend architecture, and making software that feels as good as it functions.
